# Project Template

This is a template I have created containing the basic structure of most utilities that I use in my projects.

## Features

## Git Ignore

The `.gitignore` file is set up to ignore files which are typically specific to the developer's environment, don't version control well (such as binaries), or are generated during the build process. The `.gitignore` file in this leverages the [GitHub gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) extensively.
